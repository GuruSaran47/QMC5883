I have written this module for working with the QMC5883L module whose data sheet I will be uploading to the above repo. 

It started off as a fun project now I have written code to obtain accurate directional heading of the sensor. 
Next stage I would be working on the calibration part, to actually detect the true north.

The code is written keeping the Arduino Environment in mind, I would write one for the rpi pico env in future. :)
